For developers
-------------

`getIconName.sh` - script executes command that reads OSX configuration file. 

The command looks like this - `defaults read ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.HIToolbox.plist AppleCurrentKeyboardLayoutInputSourceID`.

So you can easiliy run this command and see the output. 

For example my output for this command is `com.apple.keylayout.US`. 

It means that current layout is `US` (last part of the output). 

In the same file you can see list of **mappings** from `com.apple.keylayout.SOMETHING` to `name_of_the_flag_image` without extension in the `flags` directory.
